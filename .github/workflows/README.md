# Reciprocols

Using basic Number Theory, and investigation of sums of reciprocols.

## Question

__*Is series of partial sums ever an integer?*__

### Explanation

Consider:

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ...

Carried out to infinity, the series does not converge (i.e. it's infinite). But each partial sum is finite. Indeed each partial sum is rational. Is it ever an even integer?

### Exploration
