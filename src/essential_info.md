# Essential information for setup

For our server configuration, we'll need 4 pieces of information

1. IP Address
  * *ip_address*
  * In format of "dotted quad"
  * e.g. 52.144.45.14
  * Provided by your [VPS provider](provisioning.html) when you create a cloud server
2. Domain Name
  * *domain_name*
  * Chose from a [domain name provider](domain.html)
  * e.g. emissionsystem.org
3. Server password
  * __*server_password*__
  * You will typically use "root" as your user name, the superuser. This makes sense since only configuration work is done directly from the console
  * Used for ssh (secure shell) remote access to the server
4. Database administrator password
  * *database_password*
  * user name is *admin*
