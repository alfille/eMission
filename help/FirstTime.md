The usual process is for you to get a direct link from your mission leader that sends you straight to your **eMission** database and includes the database, username and credentials automatically, or a QR code that has those credentials.

*It is possible to visit eMission directly, which might be confusing.*

To help a new user, going directly to [https://emissionsystem.org](https://emissionsystem.org) takes you to this "Welcome" page.
