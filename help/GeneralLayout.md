## Buttons at top
The clickable buttons include links to the Mission website and specific help pages.
## Selected Patient
* The currently selected patient is shown here. This helps orient when you are editing Demographics, Notes, Medical, or Operations.
* If no patient is selected, this area will be present but blank.
* The mission name will be shown if you are editing Mission or Mission Notes
